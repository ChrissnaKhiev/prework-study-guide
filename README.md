# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

## Description

This is a study guide foe the course pre-work. This will help me understand what I will be needing to study as we continue with this course. Building this study guide will allow me to get a grasp of github and how basic HTML, CSS, and JS works.  All the while I am able to maintain a steady workflow to complete the course.

## Installation

## Usage

As the bootcamp goes on, I will be able to add notes to the various topics in the study guide. This will let me to pull from the study guide as a refresher of the previous modules.  For example, git flow was something I kept messing up on and remembering the commands and what they do will allow me to successfully maintain a workflow that won't mess up previous iterations of my code.
